## WL Wallpaper Website Project

Hello, Welcome to my repository, this is a project in which I was developing a small website that contains images so that it is responsive and well adjusted to various devices.

This way I made it as simple as possible so that you can use the skills in FlexBox, Grid and Media Query.


## Technologies Used

The languages used to carry out this project are:
<br>

<div style="display: inline_block">
<img alt="html" width="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/html5/html5-original.svg">
<img alt="html" width="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/css3/css3-original.svg">
<img alt="html" width="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg">
</div>

<br>

These are simple but effective technologies for those who want to develop something faster for training.

## What does the finished project look like?

The Finished project as a normal Website for Computers in general would look like this:

Now on other devices such as Cell Phones and Tablets it looks like this:
